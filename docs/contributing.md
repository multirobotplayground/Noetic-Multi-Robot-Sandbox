# Contributing

Write commits with two components:

1. description in imperative mood without ending with a period.
2. sequence of structured paragraphs with detailed explanation of what you have changed.

Example:

```text
Remove unused function

The function was unecessary, because of this and that.
Something will be added according to the new roadmap as specified during the meeting.
```
